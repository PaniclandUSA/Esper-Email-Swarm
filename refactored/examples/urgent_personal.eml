Hi John,

I hope you're doing well! I know you're busy with your PICTOGRAM project, but I need to remind you about something important.

The tax documents for your LLC need to be submitted by this Friday, December 6th, or we'll face penalties. I've already done most of the work, but I need you to:

1. Review the attached expense spreadsheet (checking)
2. Sign the 1099 forms I sent last week
3. Send me a scan of your Q4 receipts

Could you please handle this by Thursday evening? I want to get everything submitted early just to be safe.

Also, let's schedule a call this Sunday afternoon to discuss your literacy foundation's financial planning for 2025. I have some ideas about tax-advantaged giving structures that might help.

Love you!
Mom

P.S. - Dad says congratulations on the Turing Tour validation! He's very proud of you even if he doesn't understand what a "topological semantic plane" is. 😊
