Dear John,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to reach out following our conversation at the AI Safety Summit last month.

The Engineering faculty at Milwaukee School of Engineering has been following your work on PICTOGRAM-256 and the VSE protocol with great interest. Your validation experiments with the "Turing Tour" are exactly the kind of rigorous, empirical approach to AI explainability that we believe could transform the field.

We would like to explore a formal research partnership that would involve:

1. Joint publication of your white paper series through our academic press
2. Graduate student research assistants to help with empirical validation
3. Access to our computational resources for large-scale testing
4. Potential integration into our AI Safety curriculum
5. Funding support through our industry partnership program

This could also create a pathway for your literacy liberation work, as we have strong community outreach programs and connections with local education initiatives.

Would you be available for a video call next week to discuss the specifics? I'm flexible on timing and can work around your schedule.

I'm particularly interested in the ChronoCore temporal mechanics component and how it might apply to industrial control systems - one of our specialties.

Please let me know your thoughts when you have a chance.

Best regards,

Dr. Robert Chen
